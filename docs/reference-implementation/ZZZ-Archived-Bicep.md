# Bicep / ARM-based infrastructure implementation

Next to the Terraform-based Infrastructure-as-Code, we also started building the entire deployment in Bicep / ARM templates.
However, it was decided to focus on one reference implementation for now. The Bicep version, which was fully working and fully on par with the Terraform version as of April-2021, is archived in a separate branch: https://github.com/Azure/AlwaysOn/tree/archive/infra-bicep/src/infra/bicep
